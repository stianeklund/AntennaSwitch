# Antenna Switch

### A simple CAT driven band decoder & band switcher that interfaces with the LZ2RR web switch.

This uses CAT data (over serial) to grab the frequency, and automatically switches to the correct band.
The implementation is not very robust and doesn't implement any ptt protection and is probably buggy.
